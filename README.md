# Zepto_Product_Pricing_Stock_Analysis
Analyzed 3,700+ Zepto SKUs across 14 categories using SQL to study pricing, discounts, revenue, and stock availability. Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs, category performance, stock gaps, and price-per-gram value, focusing on accurate, business-readable insights.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze revenue distribution across product categories

Compare discount patterns by category

Identify out-of-stock products and availability gaps

Evaluate product value using unit pricing (price per gram)
